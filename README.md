### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (Make sure you have a running MongoDB instance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-app.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd your-app
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and configure your environment variables:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri

```

Replace `your-mongodb-uri` with your MongoDB connection URI and `your-secret-key` with a secret key for JWT token generation.

```

The server will start at http://localhost:3001 by default.

## Usage

After starting the server, you can navigate to http://localhost:3001/graphql to access the GraphQL Playground, which provides an interactive interface for testing the API.

You can also check out our deployed application on [Heroku!]([https://www.heroku.com/home](https://shop--123-f2fa6ddf19c1.herokuapp.com/))

## GraphQL API

123-Shop uses GraphQL for its API. The GraphQL schema includes the following types:

- `User`: Represents a user in the system.
- `Product`: Represents a product that can be associated with a business.
- `Business`: Represents a business that users can create.
- `Cart`: Represents a user's shopping cart.
- `Order`: Represents an order placed by a user.

You can find the full schema and usage examples in the `typedefs.js` file.
